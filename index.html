`Wanted to write a letter…figured I probably won’t get the chance to give you one, but figured this felt appropriate and a cool way to do it and i'm high af lol.`,
`I know I can keep saying sorry and sorry and it doesn’t really mean anything if nothing changes, but I really do understand now and I want to take accountability for how I’ve been moving. I really hear you, and I value everything you said, and I appreciate you being straight up with me even when it wasn’t your responsibility to keep explaining yourself or having to repeat things just to be understood. You shouldn’t have had to do that, and I see now how unfair and draining that must’ve been.`,
`I really respect you as a person, like genuinely. You’ve shown me a lot about myself, even the parts I don’t always wanna look at. You’re a real one, and seeing where I’m lacking and owning that it’s my own flaws I gotta work on. You helped shift something in my head in a good way and reminded me of my values and who I actually wanna be. I think there’s so much beauty in that, yeah fuck sometimes the shits just fucking annoying and the kakas been spread.. so now what. It’s gone be a beautiful artwork one day, just know. I wanna be a better person for myself, thats the most important thing, and then for the people around me. How does one try to be a light for everyone when there isn't enough fuel to begin with. The world is already so fucked up enough as it is and we’re not here to make each other’s lives even harder. Thats the last thing I ever wanna do.`,
`I’m really sorry for how draining the last couple months have been. This whole situation has forced me to reflect, and even though it’s uncomfortable, I’m grateful for that. I don’t regret any of it, but only in ways I hurt you and didn’t actually recognize what you were feeling and saying. I forget sometimes it’s really not just about what I’m feeling and what’s wrong or right. There’s always going to be a time where I have to account for someone elses feelings to be able to say I really understand or at least hold the space to acknowledge that I'm present and listening. Sometimes its not always about being understood, it's just recognizing that there is a difference and just accepting and still showing love. I know I’m not perfect and I fuck up, I know I still have growing to do. I know there’s nothing I can do right now to fix things instantly, and I get that space and time might be needed, but I hope you have it in your heart to forgive me one day. Just know I am listening, and I do want to mend things and keep growing, and becoming a better person everyday. How I align my actions with my heart is the most important thing. You’ve taught me alot in this short period of time, even though I never really factor in time. Time is just a construct. When you're with the right people, the internal clock fades because your mind shifts from passing time to experiencing the moments. It’s been great. I care about you a lot and I’m glad we had this conversation. Getting to know you showed me that connection goes way deeper than surface level shit, it’s about listening, holding space, and letting someone’s feelings exist without trying to make it about me or needing to be right. Our lenses are different or maybe I just ain’t there yet, but I value your lenses and I take it that into deep consideration and penance. But I’m on my own journey as well, so I hope you always know where my heart lies at the end of the day.`,
`Yeah, I’ll be honest and it will definitely be hard for me not to desire you in different ways. I’m sorry, but I’m not sorry bout that. It’s more than just your physicality that attracts me, I’ve gotten to know you more intimately and I guess what they say is true, there’s much more beauty than meets the eye. So when I want you it’s much more than the physicality. Why must the Gods deny me of something so great. I might die AHHH lol. I just want what I want and I don't like to accept my feats. I'll be okay though haha I'm just a passionate, sensitive motherfucker and a brat sometimes...lowe me. All in all, I’m grateful for you allowing me to experience you. Yeh I don’t think I’ll find another Tina still, but you’ve definitely upped it for me. Yeah this isn't the end of how I envisioned things to be, maybe this the part where life just makes us wait and see. And I look forward to that one day.`,
`But take care of yourself fr. I genuinely just want the best for you, you deserve the world and everything you desire. You’re gonna do the maddest things in life. Your passion , your drive, the way you move through the world, and your outscope on it all, yeah you’re cool af. You'll always have a special place in my heart. But for now we must go our separate paths, even though it pains me. </3`,
`You remind me of Sundays, cough syrup, music that feels like orange, milk yellow stars, bruises, a whole in my chest where my heart should be, rain against pavement when it's hot out and scattered ashes. You leave marks without even trying, like a mosaic of stained glass, fragments, colour, light everywhere, all staying with you after and still somehow whole.\n(...yes I can be a gay mf yuck)`,
`I hope you keep choosing yourself, your peace, and whatever keeps your fire lit. I'm gonna miss you. You da best drug I've ever had. XD`,
`I Love You Tina.\nTake care,`,
